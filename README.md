## DevCom Assignment Problem 2: Logical Skills
### Greetings!
##### Sajjad Nakhwa here, a fresher from the department of Civil Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. here is the description of the second problem of the assignment
Since I was not that familiar with python, I had to research a bit to know about the advanced concepts such as `classes`, `libraries` etc. I had a basic idea for them but it was a good revision. After reading the code doing lots of research side-by-side, I slowly began to understand it. Finally I tried implementing what was required, did some changes in the other parts of the code to fix bugs and errors, tried debugging general errors. At the end, I could not complete the problem, so I have submitted what I did.I have added comments to explain what changes I've made and why I did them. It was a good learning about concepts and things related to python. I earlier thought it was a slow language and would often undermine it, but now have realised the importance of it in the backend area.
